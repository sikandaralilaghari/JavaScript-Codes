Practices Javascript Coding 
I have completed use of the reduce method in javascript. It is used to return single value from the array.

Some Method in javaScript:
The some() method in javaScript returns a boolean value true if any of the element in a given array satisfies a given condition. Otherwise, it returns a false.

Some method is used to find any value in the array which satisfies the condition it will return value in the form of true or false. If value is found in the array it will return true other it return false. In simple words it returns true or false.
