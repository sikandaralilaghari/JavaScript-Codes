Practices Javascript Coding 
I have completed use of the reduce method in javascript. It is used to return single value from the array.

Some Method in javaScript:
The some() method in javaScript returns a boolean value true if any of the element in a given array satisfies a given condition. Otherwise, it returns a false.

Some method is used to find any value in the array which satisfies the condition it will return value in the form of true or false. If value is found in the array it will return true other it return false. In simple words it returns true or false.

Some method takes three parameters one is element which is compulsory. Remaining two methods are optional index, arr. If you want to use them in your program then you should include them.

#Every() Method in javascript:
The every() method  in javascript returns a Boolean Value true. if each and every element in array satisfies the given condition. otherwise, it returns false.
just like some method it has three parameter 1. element 2. index 3. Numbers of array
Update very method.
#Every method is used to return true or false by comparing every value in the array.

SORT METHOD IN JAVASCRIPT:
The sort() method in JavaScript is used to sort an element of an array in ascending order.

The sort() method is used to update the original when you print original array it will gives values in sorted way after the applying condition of sort method.

Now I want to sort array in the descending by using reverse method with sort

Now we are going to using sorting with numbers. with numbers when we apply numbers.sort() it does not change the array in sorting order 

I have used sort method to generate the number in ascending order and in descending.  I also find highest and lowest in the sorted array. and I have also found highest value and lowest value in reversedOrder array.



Variables and const variables in javaScript:
using of var var is global scope and again initializable 
I have example of code
Resignable yes

2. let block scoped only accessible in the block it is declared
Reassignable yes

3. const like let blocked scoped. It can't be resassignable
it declares onces


Numbers and Strings in JavaScript:
Javascript has only one number type: number, which can represent both integer and float pointing number
Special  value = infinity 1/0
