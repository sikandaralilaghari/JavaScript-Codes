Practices Javascript Coding 
I have completed use of the reduce method in javascript. It is used to return single value from the array.

Some Method in javaScript:
The some() method in javaScript returns a boolean value true if any of the element in a given array satisfies a given condition. Otherwise, it returns a false.

Some method is used to find any value in the array which satisfies the condition it will return value in the form of true or false. If value is found in the array it will return true other it return false. In simple words it returns true or false.

Some method takes three parameters one is element which is compulsory. Remaining two methods are optional index, arr. If you want to use them in your program then you should include them.

#Every() Method in javascript:
The every() method  in javascript returns a Boolean Value true. if each and every element in array satisfies the given condition. otherwise, it returns false.
just like some method it has three parameter 1. element 2. index 3. Numbers of array
Update very method.
#Every method is used to return true or false by comparing every value in the array.
